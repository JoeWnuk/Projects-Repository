A select few queries showcasing the level of SQL I am currently comfortable using (MS SQL Server)



--Creating First Table
CREATE TABLE tblEmployee
(EmployeeNumber INT PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
EmployeeFirstName VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
EmployeeMiddleName VARCHAR(50) NULL,
EmployeeLastName VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
EmployeeGovernmentID CHAR(10) NULL,
DateOfBirth DATE NOT NULL)

--Add Column
ALTER TABLE tblEmployee
ADD Department VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL;

SELECT left(EmployeeLastName, 1) as Initial, Count(*) as CountofInitial
FROM tblEmployee
WHERE DateOfBirth > '19860101'
GROUP BY left(EmployeeLastName, 1)
HAVING Count(*) >= 20
ORDER BY Count(*) Desc

--Adding Second and Third Table
CREATE TABLE tblTransaction (
Amount smallmoney Not Null,
DateOfTransaction datetime2 NULL,
EmployeeNumber int Not Null)
SELECT DISTINCT Department, convert(varchar(30), N'') as DepartmentHead
INTO tblDepartment
FROM tblEmployee

--Joining Three Tables
select D.DepartmentHead, Sum(T.Amount) as SumOfAmount, 
Count(E.EmployeeNumber) as NumberOfEmployees
from tblDepartment as D
left join tblEmployee as E
on D.Department = E.Department
left join tblTransaction T
on E.EmployeeNumber = T.EmployeeNumber
group by D.DepartmentHead
order by D.DepartmentHead

--Adding Foreign Key Constraint
Alter Table tblTransaction
ADD CONSTRAINT FK_tblTransaction_EmployeeNumber FOREIGN KEY (EmployeeNumber)
REFERENCES tblEmployee(EmployeeNumber)
