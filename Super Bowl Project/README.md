NFL Super Bowl Stats starting from Super Bowl I

With Super Bowl LV coming up in the next few weeks I thought a Super Bowl data visualization project to be appropriate. The project and datasets used were found on DataCamps website. The project aims to answer a few questions including:
  1. What were some of the highest and lowest scoring Super Bolws in history. 
  2. How does the closeness of the game affect the number of people who watch.
  3. How have views, TV ratings, and advertisement cost changed over time.
  4. What musicians have the most half time performances.
  5. What performers have the most songs performed
