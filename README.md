# Description 
This is my first project since learning to use Git and GitHub. It is a short Python script to
predict a students grade based on their 2 previous grades as well as other pieces of information
including absences, failures in other classes and study time. The data set used was taken
from UCI machine learning databases. Most of the code was written by TechwithTim and tweaked
by me to make it simpler for me to understand.

My plan in the future is to use more of the attributes in the dataset so that the model has a higher
accuracy. But first I will need to clean some of the data so it can be used.
One example is that I want to use the "sex" attribute but they are currently a string so I will need to conver them
to a integer.
