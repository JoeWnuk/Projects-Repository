# Description 
This is my first project since learning to use Git and GitHub. It is a short Python script to
predict a students grade based on their 2 previous grades as well as other pieces of information
including absences, failures in other classes and study time. The data set used was taken
from UCI machine learning databases. Most of the code was written by TechwithTim and tweaked
by me to make it simpler for me to understand. His YouTube tutorial was fantastic and allowed me to 
apply a lot of the material I have been learning into one project. 

I have added a few attributes (including health and freetime) to the data frame to improve the accuracy of the model. Currently the model is ~95.5% accuarcy.
My plan in the future is to use more of the attributes in the dataset so that the model has a higher
accuracy. But first I will need to clean some of the data so it can be used.
One example is that I want to use the "sex" attribute but they are currently a string so I will need to conver them
to a integer.
 
THis was a great introduction to machine learning and how to use Git and GitHub.
